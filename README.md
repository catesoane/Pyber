Observed Trends:


1.	There is a correlation between the total number or rides/drivers and average fare cost. Urban cities have the highest number of rides / the highest number of drivers and lowest average fare cost. The farther away you get from the city, the less rides/drivers there are and the more expensive the average fare cost is.
2.	Urban cities account for 68.42% of total rides taken and 62.97% of total fares, making urban markets the best areas for ride sharing.
3.	Urban areas have the lowest fare cost and highest amount of rides which may indicate that there is a correlation between fare cost and total number of rides.
